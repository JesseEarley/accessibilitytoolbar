# Accessibility Toolbar

The Accessibility Toolbar is a small front-end tool to help make a website more accessible for users. It includes:
* Grayscale
* Link Highlighting
* Contrast Change
* Increased Text Size

## Installation

### Requirements
* Bootstrap 3+
* jQuery (also required for Bootstrap)

Note: The Accessibility Toolbar as presented here requires Bootstrap for layout. The layout can easily be changed to a front-end framework of your choice or to CSS Grid. jQuery is used minimally and could also be removed entirely if desired.

## Usage
If using Bootstrap 3+, simply incorporate the markup from the included index.html file into your page, along with the included CSS and JS.
