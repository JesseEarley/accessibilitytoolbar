# Accessibility Toolbar - CSS Grid Branch

The Accessibility Toolbar is a small front-end tool to help make a website more accessible for users. It includes:
* Grayscale
* Link Highlighting
* Contrast Change
* Increased Text Size (This features uses CSS Zoom, which is not supported in Firefox)


## Installation

### Requirements
* CSS Grid Usage
* Font Awesome
* JavaScript

Note: The Accessibility Toolbar as presented here uses CSS Grid for layout. The CSS Grid styles are a custom 12-column grid system that uses the Bootstrap naming conventions for columns, but does NOT use Bootstrap, it is pure CSS3. The Accessibility Toolbar, as presented here requires Font Awesome for iconography, but can be removed if desired. The Accessibility Toolbar also uses JavaScript.

## Usage
If using CSS Grid, simply incorporate the markup from the included index.html file into your page, along with the included CSS and JS. Your page may need to be reconfigured to use the CSS Grid system included here, or the Accessibility Toolbar can be reworked into your existing CSS Grid system.
